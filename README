Requirements
----

° Any C++08 compiler (actually used g++ 4.8.1)
° OpenCv 2.4.* with Qt 4 support enabled
° Boost 1.53 or more recent builds



Compile on Linux machine
----

Just type 'make' in the root directory of the project.
The executable will be placed there if no errors occur.

This package is meant to be compiled and used in a linux environment.
Anyway, should be streightforward to adapt it to different architectures as both the OpenCv and boost library are cross-platform. 
In order to facilitate it, the shared library linked by the makefile are:
° boost_filesystem
° boost_system
° boost_chrono
° boost_program_options
° opencv_core
° opencv_highgui
° opencv_ml
° opencv_imgproc

If you encounter any problem check if the required libraries are installed in your system.



Usage
----

Type './barcodedetection help' to print the help message.

Command line arguments:
	-d or --dataset: full path of the directory that contains the dataset. It must constain two subdirectories: 
		 	 'Original' with the actual images, 'Detection' with the detection masks, all in png format.
			 Detection masks are black images with white-filled bounding-boxes.
			 
	-s or --show: show in a GUI some intermadiate images taken at each step of the algorihtm.
		      Press the spacebar to continue to the next image.
	
	-o or --output: set an existing directory to save some intermediate result.

	-w or --whitelist: specity a text file containing the image names (one per line) you want to process from the dataset directory.
			   Image names that do not match any element of the list are skipped.
